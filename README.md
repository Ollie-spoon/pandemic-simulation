# pandemic-simulation

This Project was created as part of a hackathon to perform simulations of epidemics. Dispite only having 2/5 members, we still were awarded a prize for data presentaion.

The project was carried out by myself, Oliver Nicholls, and Sameul Winter.

Credits for the creation of a server to run the website on, and the creation of a website to display the output of python code go to Oliver Nicholls.

Credits for the pandemic moddeling go to Samuel winter:
  The model was done from a ground up approach: By creating many individual people within a population, all who interact with a random number of other people per day following a set distribution curve, we were able to observe the macro scale outcomes of a pandemic. This method was chosen over both graph theory and SIR model approaches to pandemic modelling as we felt it had fewer assumptions.

One area we would have liked to expand upon this given more time was expanding to have different "areas" or "counties". This would have allowed us to model how the spread of a disease would treverse distance by establishing more or less strong connections between different counties. For example central London and Maidenhead have a close relation as many people commute from Maidenhead to Central London for their work. Equally, Maidenhead and Reading are only 10 miles apart and so have a strong connection that Reading would not share with Aberystwyth.
